# My odin-recipes project
A quick consolidation of all HTML principles and elements
that I've learnt from The Odin Project so far.

WIll be showing an understanding of basic HTML boilerplate writing and the 
```html
* <p>, <em>, <strong> and <h1>to<h6> formatting tags,
* <ul> and <ol> <li>st tags,
* and the image: <img> and link: <a> tags.
```

The project will be done to the specifications outlined here on: [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#assignment)
