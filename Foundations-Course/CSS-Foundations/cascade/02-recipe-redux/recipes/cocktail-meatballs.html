    <h3>Description</h3>
      These <em>tasty</em> cocktail meatballs will <strong>disappear quickly</strong> at your holiday party.
      My mom makes them every year for New Year's Eve, and now so do I.
      These do very well in a slow cooker, as you can simmer them before serving 
      and keep them hot for the duration of your party.

      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>

      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce</li>
      <li>3/4 cup chili sauce</li>

    </ul>
