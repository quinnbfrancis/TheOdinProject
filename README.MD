# TheOdinProject
Welcome to the repository containing all of my assignments and projects done in accordance with [TheOdinProject's](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) easy to follow courses.

>Containing a robust, open-source and ever improving curriculum, TOP makes it possible to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JS and Ruby entirely for free.

I've always been a tinkerer and hobbyist coder and TOP is helping me learn best practices and start creating the things of my dreams.

Whether you're here to quickly compare assignments, for a nudge in the right direction, to offer constructive critique or even to just say "Hi"

### Welcome :)
